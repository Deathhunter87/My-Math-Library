# My-Math-Library
A Java Library I made containing various mathematical concepts

Currently I have implemented:
Matrices, Fractions, Integer/Double wrapper classes

The Fractions, and Integer/Double wrapper classes extend my MyNumber class which lets them interact with eachother
The Fraction class allows fraction only operations as well as Operations with other MyNumber subclasses or Java.Lang.Number classes

The Matrix class includes:
  * Matrix **Addition**, **Subtraction**, and **Multiplication**
  * Scalar **Multiplication**, and **Division**
  * Determinant calculations for any size matrix
  * Random Matrices of any size
  * Identity Matrix constructor of any size
  * Empty Matrix constructor any size
  * Column and Row Vector constructor
  * A custom exception that is thrown when matrix operations are attempted with the wrong dimmensions
